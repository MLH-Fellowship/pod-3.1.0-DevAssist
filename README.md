## How we built it
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ![JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) ![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=markdown&logoColor=white) ![Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify-00C7B7?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify&logoColor=white)  

- Python (Flask framework)
- Javascript
- **API**: StackOverflow API
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Web Hosting**: Netlify, .Tech

## Features
- ### Website Monitoring 
Developers often spend a lot of time on the internet and sometimes we end up wasting our time instead of focusing on the task,we actually opened the browser for.This feature helps to improve the productivity of developers by keeping track of his/her website visits and also potentially blocking time-wasting or distracting websites which user wants.

- ### StackOverflow automatic error search.
It is boring and time-taking when there are too many errors in the code and you have to debug each and every error one by one.This feature eases the process a lot. It allows user to upload the file and displays all the errors in the code along with automatically opening the StackOverflow solution blogs for those corresponding errors in the browser itself.

- ### Screen Time Monitoring
Spending too much time infront of the screen affects developer's health a lot.This feature monitors the time spent by the user at different websites while recording the screentime and allows user to set the time-interval after which he wants to be alerted to take a break from screen, inorder to maintain balance between health and work.

More features to be added.
