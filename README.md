- ### StackOverflow automatic error search.
It is boring and time-taking when there are too many errors in the code and you have to debug each and every error one by one.This feature eases the process a lot. It allows user to upload the file and displays all the errors in the code along with automatically opening the StackOverflow solution blogs for those corresponding errors in the browser itself.

- ### Screen Time Monitoring
Spending too much time infront of the screen affects developer's health a lot.This feature monitors the time spent by the user at different websites while recording the screentime and allows user to set the time-interval after which he wants to be alerted to take a break from screen, inorder to maintain balance between health and work.
