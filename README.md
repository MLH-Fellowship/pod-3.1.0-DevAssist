<details><summary>Boilerplate Generator ‚úèÔ∏è</summary>
  
 <p>It is a tedious task of writing code for full stack appliaction from scratch. Use these boilerplates for your next web application !!</p>

  
  * Steps to use the boilerplate
    * * Firstly, download [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow its instructions to install it. This allows us to start using Docker containers.
    * * Then run <br>
        ```
        docker-compose build
        ```
        This spins up Compose and builds a local development environment according to our specifications in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). 
    * * After the containers have been built (this may take a few minutes), run <br>
        ```
        docker-compose up
        ``` 
        This one command boots up a local server.
    * * Now Head over to indicated localhost ports in the respective Readme to see the frontend and backend running.
    * * Finally, to gracefully stop running our local servers, you can run <br>
        ```
        docker-compose down
        ``` 
        in a separate terminal window.
